		Self-Evaluation
	</h2>
<p>
HTML/JSP: My HTML is horrible and so is my CSS. This reflects the length of time
it took to get my project working. Next time, I'll make it pretty first.
</p>
<br>
<p>
CSS: Again, this is not a pretty project. At all. I should have taken some time to 
this project pretty. Unfortunately, I got stuck on functionality for several hours
each day during the weekend.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Spring: My all my .xml files were configured properly and operational.
</p>
<br>
<p>
MVC: My databes are properly encapsulated and mapped.
</p>
<br>
<p>
JSTL: Unfortunately, I did not get this operational before turn-in. It's 
definitely something I'll be revisiting on future drafts of this project.
</p>
<br>
<p>
SQL: Although it took forever, full CRUD was implemented.
</p>
<br>
<p>
JDBC: Exceptions were handled and resources were closed.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Aesthetic: There is no aesthetic. It's terrible.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Object-Oriented Programming: This was accomplished.
</p>
